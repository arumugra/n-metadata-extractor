C# port of the [excellent Java MetadataExtractor library by Drew Noakes](https://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/). 


Automated conversion was performed with our [enhanced version of Sharpen](https://github.com/imazen/sharpen), [custom configuration](https://github.com/imazen/sharpen_imazen_config), and then a set of manual patches. MetadataExtractor 2.8.0 was converted.

Many thanks to Yakov Danilov <yakodani@gmail.com> his work in porting this library from Java to C#. 


Also, special thanks to [Ferret Renaud, who provided a C# port for many years](http://ferretrenaud.fr/Projets/MetaDataExtractor/index.html). His code can be found in the 'renaud' branch.
